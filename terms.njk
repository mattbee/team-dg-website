<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

<h2>Silent Auction Rules – Legal Clauses</h2>

<p><strong>By bidding in the FrOGS silent auctions, each bidder agrees to these auction rules.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>All sales are final. There will be no exchanges or refunds unless otherwise noted. All items are “as is.” FrOGS have attempted to describe and catalog items correctly, but neither warrants nor represents and in no event shall be responsible for the correctness of descriptions, genuineness, authorship, provenance or condition of the items. No statement made in this catalog, or made orally at the auction or elsewhere, shall be deemed such a warranty, representation, or assumption of liability.</li>
  <li>The auction item value listed is an estimate of fair market value. Items have not been appraised unless so noted. The amount you pay above this fair market value estimate is normally tax deductible as a charitable contribution. Please consult your tax adviser to clarify amount of deduction.</li>
  <li>Restaurant certificates do not include alcohol, tax, or gratuities unless specified.</li>
  <li>Payment for items purchased must be made in full before items are released to auction winners. In the event of time sensitive lots such as event tickets, it is the responsibility of the lot winner to pay and respond promptly in order to claim prizes. FrOGS accept MasterCard, Visa and other card payments only, through the payment links sent to the winners. Please allow 30 minutes after the silent auction bidding has closed before reporting to the cashier.</li>
  <li>Following payments, you may pick up your purchases in the checkout area. You must show your paid receipt for items to be picked up.</li>
  <li>The purchaser must pick up all items the night of the auction, unless special arrangements are made. Any item left unclaimed, without prior arrangements, will be sold and proceeds will go to FrOGS.</li>
  <li>FrOGS reserves the right to add or withdraw items, without notice, to or from the auction.</li>
  <li>Unless otherwise specified, all auction gift certificates must be used within one year of the date of the auction.</li>
  <li>Each person bidding assumes all risks and hazards related to the auction and items obtained at the auction. Each bidder agrees to hold harmless from any liability arising indirectly from FrOGS, their elected and appointed officials, members and employees, the auctioneer(s), the auction company and its agents and employees, the event organisers, sponsors, and/or volunteers connected with the auction.</li>
